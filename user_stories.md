# User Stories

## Instructions

Part of your assignment today is to write your own user stories. Be sure to consider the multiple roles involved: the marketing research team, the developer, and the focus group participant who will be using the application. Try to write 4-5 user stories for each role. DO THIS STEP FIRST in a file called `user_stories.md`. The commit logs in your repo will have a first couple of commits for the scaffolding process, but next you should have a 'user stories' commit that is in place before any code is written.

As a reminder, user stories typically take the form of, "As X, I want Y, so that Z" but do not necessarily need that structure.

A wise student would take about 30-45 minutes to work on the user stories and also draft a technical plan for the project (a detailed to-do list of things to make, step by step and tested at each stage) before getting into the code. That time spent in thought and planning will make the code flow a lot faster. Give yourself a series of little problems to solve (rather an a ginormous thing that you just wade through and poke at).

## Marketing Research Team user stories

- [] As a researcher, I want to see a graph of user clicks, so that I can see which products are popular.
- [] As a researcher, I want a view a total number of user votes, so that I know what products and items are most appealing.
- [] As a researcher, I want a chart, so that I can visually see and track user votes/clicks.
- [] As a researcher, I want to track products, so that I can view the data easily.

## Developer User Stories

- [] As a developer, I want to create a constructor, so that I can be able to create multiple instances when handling multiple images.
- [] As a developer, I want to create a clean UX/UI page, so that users can be able to understand the page.
- [] As a developer, I want to create an event handler so that handles keeping track of user clicks.
- [] As a developer, I want to create a function that keeps track of user votes so that I can generate results for the user.
- [] As a developer, I want to keep track of 25 selections made, so that this prevents the user to do additional voting.

## Focus Group Participant User Stories

- [] As a user, I want a clear display of images, so that I can click on a product that I like.
- [] As a user, I want to view a clean website, so that I can understand and select images easily.
- [] As a user, I want to see a set of instructions, so that I know what to do when I am on the page.
- [] As a user, I want to see my product selections, so that I can be able to keep track on the items clicked.
- [] As a user upon receiving a click, I want to see three new non-duplicating random images so that I do not have to see it again.
